# My First C# Console App 🚀

This is my very first C# console application!  
In this project, I explored the basics of C# by:

- Introducing **five fundamental data types**
- Practicing **escape sequences** (like `\n`, `\t`, `\\`, `\"`)
- Displaying formatted text using `Console.WriteLine()`
- Understanding how data types behave in simple output scenarios

---

## 📘 What I Learned

### ✔ Data Types Included:
- `string`
- `int`
- `double`
- `bool`
- `char`

### ✔ Escape Sequences Used:
- `\n` → new line   
- `\'` → quotation mark  

These helped me format text cleanly and make the output more readable.
